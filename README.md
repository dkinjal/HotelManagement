  <h2> XP Core Values</h2> 
 <ul>   
<li> Communication: We conducted in-person meetings atleast once a week and updated each other about our individual components. We ensured transparent and effective communication to update about our timelines and committments.
<li> Feedback: After every sprint cycle, we conducted a meeting solely for the purpose of feedback. We demonstrated our components to each other and asked/gave feedback to others' components on what better can be done.
<li> Simplicity: The team was always working towards delivering products with absolutely necessary features though which we were able to omit unnecessary  items and code. This helped to keep out code very clean and organised. Even for documenting the progress and maintaining the repository, we approached in a fairly simple manner.
     </ul>
